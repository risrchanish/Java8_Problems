**Assignment 1: To practice using Default and Static Methods**

**Tasks:**

1. Create an interface called `Shape` with the following methods:

   * `double calculateArea()` – calculates and returns the area of the shape.
   * `default void printShapeDetails()` – prints the details of the shape, including its type and area.
   * `static void printShapeCount(List<Shape> shapes)` – prints the total count of shapes in the given list.

2. Implement the `Shape` interface with classes representing different types of shapes (e.g., `Circle`, `Rectangle`, `Triangle`).

3. Write a program that defines a list of shapes and performs the following operations:

   * Calculate and print the area of each shape in the list.
   * Print the details of each shape in the list using the default method `printShapeDetails`.
   * Print the total count of shapes using the static method `printShapeCount`.

**Example Output:**

```
Shapes list:

1. Circle - Radius: 5.0, Area: 78.54  
2. Rectangle - Length: 4.0, Width: 6.0, Area: 24.0  
3. Triangle - Base: 3.0, Height: 4.0, Area: 6.0
```
