	 * Assignment 3: Java Functional Programming and Stream API

---

**Assignment 3:**

**Objective:** To practice using lambda expressions and the Optional class.

**Tasks:**

1. Write a program that defines a functional interface `MathOperation` with a method
   `double operate(double a, double b)`. This interface should represent a mathematical
   operation that takes two doubles as input and returns a double result.

2. Implement four different mathematical operations using lambda expressions:

   * Addition
   * Subtraction
   * Multiplication
   * Division

3. Write a method `performOperation` that takes two doubles and a `MathOperation` instance 
	as parameters and returns the result of applying the operation to the input values.

4. In the main method, demonstrate the use of the `performOperation` method by performing various 
	mathematical operations (e.g., 10 + 5, 20 - 8, 6 \* 3, 15 / 3) using lambda expressions.

5. Extend the program to handle division by zero. Modify the `performOperation` method 
	to return an `Optional<Double>` instead of a double. If division by zero occurs, return an empty `Optional`.

6. Test the modified program by attempting to perform division by zero and verify that the Optional returned is empty.
