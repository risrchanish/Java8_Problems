**Tasks:**

1. Write a program that defines a list of integers.
2. Use lambda expressions to perform the following operations on the list:

   * Print all the elements in the list.
   * Print only the even elements in the list.
   * Print the sum of all the elements in the list.
3. Create a functional interface `NumberProcessor` with a method `void process(int number)`.
4. Implement the following methods using lambda expressions:

   * `printNumbers`: Accepts a list of integers and a `NumberProcessor` instance and processes each number in the list using the `process` method of the `NumberProcessor`.
   * `filterAndPrint`: Accepts a list of integers, a `NumberProcessor` instance, and a predicate function. It filters the numbers in the list based on the predicate and then processes each filtered number using the `NumberProcessor`.
   * `sumNumbers`: Accepts a list of integers and returns the sum of all the numbers in the list.
5. In the main method, demonstrate the use of the implemented methods by:

   * Printing all the numbers in the list.
   * Filtering and printing only the even numbers in the list.
   * Calculating and printing the sum of all the numbers in the list.
