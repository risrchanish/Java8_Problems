**Assignment 1 : To practice using Method References**

**Tasks:**

1. Create a class called `StringManipulator` with the following static methods:

   * `static void print(String str)` - prints the given string.
   * `static int compareLength(String str1, String str2)` - compares the lengths of two strings and 
   		returns an integer indicating their relative lengths.

2. Write a program that defines a list of strings.

3. Use method references to perform the following operations on the list of strings:

   * Print all the strings in the list using the `StringManipulator.print` method reference.
   * Sort the strings in the list based on their lengths using the `StringManipulator.compareLength` method reference.
   * Print the sorted list of strings.

**Example Output:**

Original list of strings: \[banana, apple, pineapple, orange, strawberry]

Strings in the list:
banana
apple
pineapple
orange
strawberry
